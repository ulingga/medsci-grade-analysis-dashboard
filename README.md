# UoA School of Medical Sciences Grade Analysis Dashboard
Shiny + RMarkdown workflow for the SMS Board of Examiners / Board of Studies grade analysis (Canvas ETL, UG/PG wide tables, automated PDF reports).

# BoE / BoS Grade Analysis – Multi-paper Shiny

This repository contains an R Shiny + RMarkdown workflow for **Board of Examiners (BoE)** and **Board of Studies (BoS)** grade analysis across multiple papers.

The project has two main components:

1. **Shiny ETL App**  
   - Academics upload Canvas grade exports for multiple papers.  
   - The app standardises them into a **single long-format ETL table**.  
   - It outputs **UG- and PG-wide Excel tables** ready for Board to review, and  
   - Triggers a parameterised RMarkdown report using the combined ETL.

2. **Automated Grade Analysis Report (RMarkdown)**  
   - Consumes the ETL generated by the Shiny app.  
   - Produces a **BoE/BoS-ready PDF** with summary statistics, tables and plots:
     - Enrolments and unique students by stage and paper  
     - Paper-level summary stats (mean, median, SD, fail %)  
     - Stage-level summary  
     - DNC/DNS tables  
     - Distributional plots (boxplots, densities)  
     - Paired t-tests between papers with overlapping enrolments  

> **Important:** No real student data is stored in this repository. All sensitive Canvas files are handled locally and are ignored via `.gitignore`.
